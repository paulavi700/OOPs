        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which combine **data** (attributes) and **behavior** (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        " ---\n",
        "\n",
        " ### üîπ Key Concepts:\n",
        " - **Class** ‚Äì Blueprint for creating objects  \n",
        " - **Object** ‚Äì Instance of a class  \n",
        " - **Encapsulation** ‚Äì Bundling data and methods  \n",
        " - **Abstraction** ‚Äì Hiding complex details  \n",
        " - **Inheritance** ‚Äì Reusing code from parent classes  \n",
        " - **Polymorphism** ‚Äì Same interface, different behavior\n",
        "\n",
        " ---\n",
        "\n",
        " OOP makes code more **modular**, **reusable**, and **easier to manage**.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        " - A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the attributes (data/properties) and methods (functions/behavior) that the created objects will have.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        " - An object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and contains both data (attributes/properties) and behavior (methods/functions) defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " - Sure! Here's a short and precise version:\n",

        "\n",
        " 5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - **Dunder methods** (short for **\"double underscore\" methods**) in Python are special methods surrounded by double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`). They are used to define how objects behave with built-in functions and operators.\n",

        "  ### üîπ Common Examples:\n",
        "  - `__init__` ‚Üí Object constructor  \n",
        "  - `__str__` ‚Üí String representation (`print(obj)`)  \n",
        "  - `__add__` ‚Üí Defines behavior for `+`  \n",
        "  - `__len__` ‚Üí Used with `len()`  \n",
        "  - `__eq__` ‚Üí Used with `==`\n",

        "6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        " - **Inheritance** in OOP allows a **child class** to **inherit** attributes and methods from a **parent class**, promoting **code reuse**.\n",
        "\n",
        " ---\n",
        "\n",
        " ### üîπ Key Points:\n",
        " - The child class can **extend** or **override** parent class functionality.\n",
        " - Represents an **\"is-a\"** relationship (e.g., Dog *is a* Animal).\n",
        "\n",
        " ---\n",
        "\n",
        " ###  Example:\n",
        " ```python\n",
        " class Animal:\n",
        "     def speak(self):\n",
        "             return \"Some sound\"\n",

        "                         ```\n",
        "\n",
        "                         Inheritance helps in **reducing code duplication** and improving **maintainability**.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        " - **Polymorphism** in OOP allows objects of different classes to respond to the same **method** in their own way.\n",
        "\n",
        " ### üîπ Types:\n",
        " - **Method Overriding**: Child class redefines parent class method.\n",
        " - **Method Overloading**: Same method name with different parameters (not directly supported in Python).\n",
        "\n",
        " ###  Example:\n",
        " ```python\n",
        " class Animal:\n",
        "     def speak(self):\n",
        "             return \"Some sound\"\n",
        "\n",
        "             class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "                 def speak(self):\n",
        "                         return \"Bark\"\n",

        "                             Polymorphism enhances **code flexibility** and **reusability**.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        " - **Encapsulation** in Python is achieved by **hiding** internal object data (attributes) and providing **getter** and **setter** methods to control access.\n",
        "\n",
        " ### üîπ How to Achieve:\n",
        " 1. **Private Attributes**: Prefix with `__` (double underscore) to make them private.\n",
        " 2. **Getter and Setter Methods**: Methods to access or modify private data.\n",
        "\n",
        " ### Example:\n",
        " ```python\n",
        " class Account:\n",
        "     def __init__(self, balance):\n",
        "             self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "                 def get_balance(self):\n",
        "                         return self.__balance\n",
        "\n",
        "                             def set_balance(self, amount):\n",
        "                                     if amount >= 0:\n",
        "                                                 self.__balance = amount\n",
        "\n",
        "                                                 account = Account(1000)\n",
        "                                                 account.set_balance(1500)\n",
        "                                                 print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500\n",
        "                                                 ```\n",
        "\n",
        "                                                 Encapsulation protects data and controls how it's accessed and modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        " - A **constructor** in Python is a special method called `__init__` that is automatically invoked when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        " ### üîπ Key Points:\n",
        " - The `__init__` method is called when you create an instance of a class.\n",
        " - It typically initializes the object with values provided during instantiation.\n",
        "\n",
        " ###  Example:\n",
        " ```python\n",
        " class Person:\n",
        "     def __init__(self, name, age):  # Constructor\n",
        "             self.name = name\n",
        "                     self.age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "                     p1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)  # Constructor is called\n",
        "                     print(p1.name, p1.age)     # Output: Alice 30\n",
        "                     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "                     The constructor helps **initialize object properties** when an object is created.\n",
        "10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        " - In Python, **class methods** and **static methods** are two types of methods that are not bound to instance objects but instead belong to the class itself.\n",
        "\n",
        " ### üîπ **Class Method**:\n",
        " - Defined using the `@classmethod` decorator.\n",
        " - Takes **`cls`** as the first parameter (refers to the class).\n",
        " - Can modify class-level attributes or call other class methods.\n",
        "\n",
        " ### üêç Example:\n",
        " ```python\n",
        " class MyClass:\n",
        "     count = 0\n",

        "                             - Defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.\n",
        "                             - Doesn't take `self` or `cls` as the first parameter.\n",
        "                             - Doesn't modify class or instance attributes; used for utility functions related to the class.\n",

        "                                             - **Class Method**: Works with class-level data.\n",
        "                                             - **Static Method**: Independent of class or instance data.\n",
        "                                      \n",
        "11.What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        " - **Method overloading** in Python refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. However, Python does not support traditional method overloading like other languages (e.g., Java). Instead, the latest method definition overrides the previous ones.\n",
        "\n",
        " To achieve overloading-like behavior, you can use **default arguments**, **variable-length arguments** (`*args`, `**kwargs`), or custom logic inside a single method.\n",
        "\n",
        " ###  Example using default arguments:\n",
        " ```python\n",
        " class MyClass:\n",
        "     def greet(self, name=\"Guest\"):\n",
        "             print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "             obj = MyClass()\n",
        "             obj.greet()         # Output: Hello, Guest!\n",
        "             obj.greet(\"Alice\")  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
        "             ```\n",
        "\n",
        "             This mimics method overloading by handling different numbers of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "  12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "   - **Method overriding** in OOP occurs when a **child class** provides a **specific implementation** of a method that is already defined in its **parent class**. The child class method **replaces** the parent class method.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ### üîπ Key Points:\n",
        "   - The method in the child class **has the same name** and **signature** as in the parent class.\n",
        "   - It allows the child class to **customize** or **extend** the functionality of the inherited method.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ### üêç Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Animal:\n",
        "       def speak(self):\n",
        "               return \"Some sound\"\n",
        "\n",
        "               class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "                   def speak(self):\n",
        "                           return \"Bark\"\n",
        "\n",
        "                           dog = Dog()\n",
        "                           print(dog.speak())  # Output: Bark\n",
        "                           ```\n",
        "\n",
        "                           Method overriding enables **polymorphism** and allows child classes to provide specific behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "  13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - The **`@property` decorator** in Python is used to define a **getter** method for an attribute, allowing it to be accessed like a regular attribute (without needing parentheses), while still controlling access to it via a method.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ### üîπ Key Points:\n",
        "  - **Getter Method**: Allows access to an attribute's value in a controlled way.\n",
        "  - Can be used with **setter** and **deleter** methods for more control over attribute modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ### üêç Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  class Circle:\n",
        "      def __init__(self, radius):\n",
        "              self._radius = radius\n",
        "\n",
        "                  @property\n",
        "                      def radius(self):\n",
        "                              return self._radius\n",
        "\n",
        "                                  @radius.setter\n",
        "                                      def radius(self, value):\n",
        "                                              if value >= 0:\n",

        "### üîπ How It Works:\n",
        "- Methods return `self` (the current object) to allow further method calls on the same object.\n",
        "- It improves code **conciseness** and **readability**.\n",

        "- The **`__call__`** method in Python allows an object to be called like a function. It enables instances of a class to behave as callable objects, meaning you can use parentheses `()` on an object to invoke the method.\n",
